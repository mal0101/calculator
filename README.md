## Calculator:
This calculator program uses tkinter for the GUI part and the math library for its operations.

### In Python:
Implemented a Calculator with the following Mathematical Operations:
    - Addition;
    - Substraction;
    - Multiplication;
    - Int Division;
    - Dec Division;
    - Modulo;
    - Power;
    - Sqrt;
    - Logarithm;
    - Exponential.

I also implemented a GUI for this version of the Calculator, still needs a lot of fixing since it's very primitive.
